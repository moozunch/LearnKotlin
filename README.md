Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be uniqueâ€”instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).

Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications. It allows you to write concise and expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks, all with a smooth learning curve:
<b>Expressiveness</b>, <b>Scalability</b>, <b>Interoperability</b>, <b>Migration</b>, and <b>Tooling</b>

* Kotlin is a language developed by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> and to use it you need to use one of JetBrains IDE in which is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> or <a href="[https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://developer.android.com/studio)">Android Studio</a>. <br>
* In this opportunity aswell I'm using IntelliJ as I only learn basic Kotlin but I also using Android Studio for my application with Kotlin as backend programing language of the application.

<h4>Kotlin Overview</h4>

```
//Kotlin has a lot of template, one is only type main then enter it will autocomplete function main
fun main(){
    //fun for function, main function without parameters
    println("Hello World") //Print and new line
    //no semicolon needed, but if you want to use it is fine aswell
    println(3+3)
    //Case Sensitives
    print("Halo Dunia") // Print Without new line

}
```
